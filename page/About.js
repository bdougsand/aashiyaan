            <Strong>Aashiyaan</Strong> is an interactive mobile documentary that has been co-created by domestic workers, homemakers and a filmmaker from Delhi. Filmed entirely in India, the transmedia project was developed with support from artists, volunteers, hackers and friends in New Delhi, India; Ryerson and York Universities, Canada; <A href="http://codeforboston.org">Code for Boston, USA</A> and the <A href="http://opendoclab.mit.edu">Open Documentary Lab</A> at MIT, USA.

            When cities are labelled unsafe, women appear as statistics and victims.  This documentary is a living archive of the lives and experiences of the 'invisible' women of Delhi. It invites viewers to listen to and participate in womenâ€™s conversations about how they navigate unsafe urban geographies
